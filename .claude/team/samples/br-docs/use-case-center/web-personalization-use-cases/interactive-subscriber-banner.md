## Use case items

With this use case, you’ll get an:

* 4 Interactive banner templates

* **Evaluation dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard provides insights into user behavior, campaign performance, and overall engagement metrics. The dashboard allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing strategies and make data-driven decisions.

## How to deploy the use case

After downloading the use case, follow these steps.

### Meet the requirements

Check if the data in your project [meets the requirements](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/how-to-meet-the-requirements). The Use Case Center lists requirements for each use case during the deployment process.

### Understand the use case logic

The banner is displayed to customers who trigger the session\_start event for the first time. Its primary goal is to collect consent in exchange for a discount voucher, presented after the customer provides their email or SMS details. The banner appears automatically 100 milliseconds after the website starts loading.

The use case includes four banners. Each banner consists of multiple questions with these types of answers:

* Single choice with number selection
* Multiple choice
* Multiple choice with cards and images
* Single choice with images

The banners differ in the order of questions and answers. **You can set up the content of the questions and answers but not the order of the questions.**

The answers to the questions are tracked in the customer events.

### Adjust the use case

Now that you understand the use case logic, you can set up the use case according to your needs.

#### Banner settings

Access the banner and go to the **Settings** tab to adjust the [banner settings](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/how-to-adjust-the-banner-design-and-settings-in-the-use-case-center#settings).

#### Design and copy

Customize the [banner visuals and copy](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/how-to-adjust-the-banner-design-and-settings-in-the-use-case-center) to reflect your company's brand identity.

Once the testing is over, run the use case. Open the banner and click **Start** to launch the campaign.

### Evaluate the results

Remember to run the use case for a few days to see the impact.

After this initial period, use the prebuilt [evaluation dashboard](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/how-to-evaluate-a-use-case-in-the-use-case-center) to measure and analyze relevant data.

1. Open the evaluation dashboard
